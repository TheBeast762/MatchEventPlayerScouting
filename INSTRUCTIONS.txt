A practical approach
You're expected to provide an A-Z sports data science use case, where you explain 1. the demand of the 'client' (a sports practitioner, athlete, coach, manager, etc..), 2. what your data looks like and how you structure it to address the question at hand, 3. the modelling technique that you've applied (data science, computer vision..), and 4. how your data-driven answer can be given back to the 'client'. The third component is the most important as we want to see how innovative and interesting your approach is.

Creativity
We understand that tackling each of these 4 challenges is a bit ambitious, so you are permitted to take a shortcut if necessary. For example, for how you provide your feedback: feel free to make a mock-up using paint, rather than developing a web-app in R shiny. We deem creativity in the data analyses more important than a complete pipeline from A-Z. If you need to take a shortcut or make some assumptions, we are OK with that if it means you can do something very new and creative. Feel free to consult us about a specific 'shortcut'.

1. Event data in football
A lot has been said about football data during this course. Now, you get the chance to actually work with quite some football data. For this assignment, the student is expected to come up with novel insights that can aid a coach, manager or player in their daily decisions. What to do on the pitch in a given context? This type of data also lends itself for opponent mining: What to do against a specific opponent? In your analyses make sure you distinguish the obvious (e.g., if penalty  high chance of scoring) from the interesting. Your analysis should most likely include an assessment of the typical behaviour of ‘our’ team and a suggested improvement. Given that this dataset has been properly structured and used for many research questions in the past, you are expected to go above and beyond the already existing work.
